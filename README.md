# track-anything
Python + SQLite3-based tracking software

## About
This is a little tool I made that uses PyQt to create what essentially serves as a connection to an SQLite3 database that allows you to create "trackers" to track anything you want. It was made to be pretty modular as a result, with different data types that all are encoded into tables in the SQLite3 database (which will be called trackers.db upon creation of your first table). This is currently a work in progress and many core features are still missing. 

### What is currently left to do:
Define all data type
Create data viewing method
Implement some statistics
Add some analysis tools depending on data type
Make UI prettier and customizeable
