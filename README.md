# track-anything
Python + SQLite3-based tracking software

## About
This is a little tool I made that uses PyQt to create what essentially serves as a connection to an SQLite3 database that allows you to create "trackers" to track anything you want. It was made to be pretty modular as a result, with different data types that all are encoded into tables in the SQLite3 database (which will be called trackers.db upon creation of your first table). This is currently a work in progress and many core features are still missing. 

### Downloads
Download the latest .exe of this project at [Releases](https://github.com/TyHanson/track-anything/releases)

Since this whole project is kind of based around the idea of getting a ton of data on your own life (for the trackers), I am going to try to push releases out whenever I add new functions as much as I can. There should also be an auto-updater in this project sometime soon, so hopefully you won't need to worry about this after I get the first release set up and pushed out!

### What is currently left to do:
Define all data type
Create data viewing method
Implement some statistics
Add some analysis tools depending on data type
Make UI prettier and customizeable
